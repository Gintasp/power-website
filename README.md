# Summary:

Building another real-world scale webpage made me consider using BEM or OOCSS in the upcoming projects to maintain my CSS code more easily. For this project I used a little bit of jQuery as it was fun to brush the dust off of long-time unused skills. After finishing this project, I feel that I've mastered HTML and CSS to a level where I feel comfortable writing it.
